# LMST3D-Resnet in Tensorflow

A TensorFlow implementation of  multiple local 3D CNN spatial-temporal residual networks (LMST3D-Resnet) from the pape (Multiple local 3D CNNs for region-based prediction in smart
cities) LMST3D-ResNet can also combine the spatial-temporal features with external factors. LMST3D-ResNet includes 3D CNNs and ResNet mechanisms for processing spatial-temporal information.




## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6
* Tensorflow 1.13
* Keras  2.1.3

## Usage

To create the TensorFlow computation graph of the LMST3D-Resnet architecture run:

    $ python main.py
